title: What I've being up to the past month
---

Over the past month I've being broading my skills in penetration testing and linux.

I've owned 2 more boxes on hackthebox.eu and completed the snake challenge.
Luke and SwagShop were really interesting boxes to complete as I got to use what I learnt from the previous boxes and apply that knowledge there. That allowed me to get part of the way and I still had to do more research into how to exploit the boxes. I found that I gained confidence in learning how to research and find exploits and use them. 

A course I've being taking on udemy is really useful if you're just beginning with pentesting. It covers a lot of different skills and is helping me change the way I think when it comes to pentesting.

Over the wire is a really good learning tool for learning about linux commands. It gives you hints on what commands to use but doesn't tell you how to use them. It's your job to work out how to use them to complete each level.

My next set of goals will be to finish what I've being learning and try do some of the retired hackthebox machines to get a better understanding of how to harder machines as well look more into doing exploits on windows servers. My end goal is to get prepared enough for taking the OSCP exam.
