# Kawaiicon 2019

Kawaiicon is a infosec conference but cuter held in Wellington. I attended it this year 2019. It was my first experience at a conference and I really enjoyed the time I got to spent there, listening to talks, meeting new people and volunteering. 

Some of my favourite talks were:

#### (Not) hacking your biology by Sophia Frentz.
    It was really interesting learning about keeping your data safe in the health industry and that often the best practices aren't applied.

#### Physical Access Control on Sesame Street by Matthew Daley.
    Learning about all the work Matthew put into learning about the Gallagher card system was great. The amount of time and effort he put into this shows. Hopefully he can get his laptop back from the police.

#### The story of the "Uncrackable" Lockbox, and Why Hackers Need to Work Alongside Developers by Matthew Ruffell.
    I enjoyed learning how not to make a secure box and the lesson that the product maker learnt is to engage more with security.

#### Super self-service: hacking kiosks using barcodes by Shaquin and Ben.
    Quite suprising how insecure the self kiosk systems are. 

#### A security tale by Fobski.
    This was a really good talk, especially the parts of mental well-being.

#### Liar, Liar: a first-timer "red-teaming" under unusual restrictions by l0ss.
    This red team talk was cool to listen to and can show that clients may want red teaming but not actually want actual red teaming which can be difficult.

Progressing towards taking OSCP, will upload some of the work I've being doing in October. Kioptrix 1,2,3 and a hackthebox writeup.
